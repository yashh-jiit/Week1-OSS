The provided C++ code implements a basic console-based To-Do List application that allows users to add, view, search, and delete tasks. It starts by including necessary libraries for input-output operations and string handling. A global integer variable `ID` is used to track task IDs, and a `todo` struct represents a task with an ID and a description.

The **addTodo** function clears the screen, displays a welcome message, and prompts the user to enter a new task. This task is written to "todo.txt" with an incremented ID, and the current ID is saved to "id.txt". If the user wants to add another task, the function recursively calls itself; otherwise, it exits after confirming the task addition.

The **readData** function clears the screen, displays a welcome message, and reads tasks from "todo.txt", displaying each task's ID and description until the end of the file is reached. This allows users to view all added tasks.

The **searchData** function clears the screen, displays a welcome message, and prompts the user to enter a task ID to search for. It reads through "todo.txt" to find and display the task with the matching ID.

The **deleteData** function searches for a task using **searchData** and confirms if the user wants to delete it. If confirmed, it copies all tasks except the one to be deleted into a temporary file "temp.txt", then replaces "todo.txt" with "temp.txt", effectively deleting the selected task.

In the **main** function, the program initializes the console, reads the last used ID from "id.txt", and enters a loop where it prompts the user to choose an action: add a task, view tasks, search for a task, or delete a task. Based on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding function to perform the operation, allowing multiple operations continuously.
